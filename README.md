# Breast - Histopathology
Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer in women, and Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) is the most common form of breast cancer. Accurately identifying and categorizing breast cancer subtypes is an important clinical task, and automated methods can be used to save time and reduce error.<br>
#### This is a Computer Vision project which aims to predict whether cell tissues contain IDC.
Major Tech Stack:
<br>->PyTorch 1.2
<br>->OpenCV
# How to use?
Note: To maintain the ennvironments, I highly recommend using [conda](https://anaconda.org/).
```
git clone https://github.com/aitikgupta/breast_histopathology.git
cd breast_histopathology
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate {environment name, for eg. conda activate cv}
jupyter notebook Breast_Histopathology.ipynb
```
